				<h1 class="section-heading">Ways you can Manage Your Stress</h1>
				<div class="container">
				<p>Below are some simple tips you can try using to manage your levels of stress:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Engage in physical activity, being active and getting you blood pumping helps restore both your mind and body to be calm and relaxed.</li>
					<li>Meditation, deep breathing and concentrated stretching can help alleviate physical stress or tension you may unknowingly have. Even consider massage or book an appointment with a chiropractor as a lot of body imbalances/tension/injuries can affect the mind.</li>
					<li>Engage with other people, You may have a friend, family member or work colleague with whom you can talk to  in order to relieve yourself of stressful thoughts. This may be thought of as venting however if its someone you trust or someone who cares for you they should be able to understand and try to help your situation.</li>
					<li>Take care of your self, not only should you exercise your body, you should also be nurturing it with a balanced diet. It is common for people to associate stress with bad eating habits which in turn will make you feel worse, so consider more variety as well as avoiding the junk. Lastly resting a healthy 7-8 hours a night can really do wonders on your mood and energy. This may seem obvious but some people just brush it off not understanding the importance of letting your brain rest in order to have proper function.</li>
					<li>Be more honest to yourself, try to put yourself first and make your own choices, having people decide for you or being forced into a decision you don't want to make can be a real factor to causing stress to some people. The point is just to think by yourself for yourself so that you can have more control over what you do in your life.</li>
					<li>Avoid stimulants and depressants, stimulants like Caffeine and Nicotine will make you feel more alert but they make your body do unnecessary work which can increase your levels of stress. Alcohol in general is a bad choice to be making, it taxes your organs and consuming large amounts can make you stressed. Instead try drinking herbal teas, natural juices and generally keep hydrated.</li>
					<li>The last point is an underlying one which is present in all of the previous points, which is to engage. Meaning if you don't actively try to change your situation and instead consequentially worsen it, your levels of stress will only get worse and it will be harder to relieve yourself of stress.</li>
				</ul>
